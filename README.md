# 2048 Game
2048 is a simple yet addictive puzzle game created by Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. The player controls tiles on a 4x4 grid, sliding them in four directions: up, down, left, or right. Tiles with the same numbers merge to form a new tile with their sum (e.g., 2+2=4, 4+4=8, and so on).  

The game's goal is to reach the **2048** tile, but the game can continue as long as moves are possible. It requires strategic thinking and planning to manage the grid space effectively and prevent it from filling up.
